	  The JSON-D-Bus-bridge is a fastcgi application that provides access to D-Bus.
	  It accepts JSON-RPC calls as used for instance by qooxdoo and translates these into D-Bus calls. Any response is converted back to JSON and sent to the client.
	  The bridge is completely generic. New D-Bus services can be added without modifications to the bridge.
